## 📧 Email Functionality Successfully Restored!

### ✅ **What Was Implemented**

**1. Email Service Restored** (`lib/email-service.ts`)
- Complete email sending functionality using Resend
- All email templates integrated (BookingConfirmation, NewBooking, ServiceStarted, ServiceCompleted, BookingCancelled)
- Proper error handling and logging
- Uses environment variable `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` for sender address

**2. Email Helpers** (`lib/email-helpers.ts`)
- `buildEmailNotificationData()` - Builds email data from booking information
- `safeEmailSend()` - Safe email sending with error handling (won't break booking flow)
- Works with current database structure

**3. Booking API Integration** (`app/api/bookings/route.ts`)
- ✅ **FCM notifications remain completely intact**
- ➕ **NEW: Email notifications added in parallel**
- Emails sent for: New bookings, Status changes (confirmed, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
- Independent error handling (email failures don't affect booking creation)

**4. COD Payment Integration** (`app/api/payments/cod-confirm/route.ts`)
- ✅ **FCM notifications remain completely intact**
- ➕ **NEW: Email notifications added for COD bookings**

**5. Quote Request Integration** (`lib/negotiation-services.ts`)
- ✅ **FCM notifications remain completely intact**
- ➕ **NEW: Email notifications added for quote requests**

**6. Test Endpoint** (`app/api/test-email/route.ts`)
- Test all email types independently
- Useful for debugging and verification

### 🔄 **Dual Notification System Now Active**

**Users will now receive:**

1. **FCM Push Notifications** (immediate, browser) ← **Unchanged, working as before**
2. **In-App Notifications** (persistent, in app) ← **Unchanged, working as before**
3. **Email Notifications** (formal, inbox) ← **✨ NEWLY RESTORED**

### 📧 **Email Flow**

| Event | Customer Email | Provider Email |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| New Booking Created | ❌ | ✅ New Booking Notification |
| Booking Confirmed | ✅ Booking Confirmation | ❌ |
| Service Started | ✅ Service Started | ❌ |
| Service Completed | ✅ Service Completed | ❌ |
| Booking Cancelled | ✅ Booking Cancelled | ❌ |
| Quote Request | ❌ | ✅ Quote Request Notification |

### 🛠️ **Environment Setup Required**

Make sure these environment variables are set:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=notifications@sniket.com
```

### 🧪 **Testing the Email System**

**Test individual emails:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "testType": "booking_confirmation",
    "customerEmail": "customer@test.com", 
    "providerEmail": "provider@test.com"
  }'
```

**Available test types:**
- `booking_confirmation`
- `new_booking_notification`
- `service_started`
- `service_completed`
- `booking_cancelled`

### ✅ **FCM Safety Confirmed**

- **Zero changes** to existing FCM code
- **Zero changes** to existing notification database structure
- **Zero changes** to existing in-app notification system
- Email system runs **in parallel** - if emails fail, FCM still works
- Independent error handling for each system

### 🚀 **Ready to Use**

The email system is now restored and ready! Create a new booking or test with the test endpoint to verify everything is working.

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up your Resend API key
2. Test with real booking creation
3. Verify emails are being sent
4. Confirm FCM notifications still work as before
